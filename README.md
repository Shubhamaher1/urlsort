One of many url shortening apps out there. Was inspired by an article I read at:

http://screencasts.org/episodes/activerecord-with-sinatra

This project is currently live at:

https://emlink.me

I added quite a few things.

1. Now uses rack-fiber_pool, em_mysql2, em-resolv-replace, em-synchrony, and em-http-request for async requests.
2. Fully localized with i18n.
3. Added sass support.
4. Added copy support via clipboard.js.
5. XML, JSON, and YAML url details.
6. Dalli for speedy memcached support.
7. Tux is included for console debugging.
8. Support for docker-compose.

To start the server:

```
bundle exec thin -R config.ru start
```

This will fire it up on port 3000.

To run the tests:

```
RACK_ENV=test rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake test
```

To launch a console:

```
bundle exec rake console
```
