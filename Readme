One of many url shortening apps out there. Was inspired by an article I read at:

http://screencasts.org/episodes/activerecord-with-sinatra

I added quite a few things.

1. Now uses rack-fiber_pool for async requests.
2. Fully localized with i18n
3. Templates are flushed out and look good.
4. Added bundler and rvm support.
5. Added less support.

To start the server:

thin -R config.ru start

This will fire it up on port 3000. You can set your hostname in en.yml
