em-shorty 0.4.0

One of many url shortening apps out there. Was inspired by an article I read at:

http://screencasts.org/episodes/activerecord-with-sinatra

This project is currently live at:

http://emlink.me

I added quite a few things.

1. Now uses rack-fiber_pool, em_mysql2, and em-resolv-replace for async requests.
2. Fully localized with i18n
3. Templates are flushed out and look good.
4. Added bundler and rvm support.
5. Added less support.
6. Battery of Unit Tests.
7. Added copy support via ZeroClipboard - http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/
8. XML, JSON, YAML support.
9. Dalli for speedy memcache support.
10. Supports async http requests via em-http-request.

To run the tests:

RACK_ENV=test rake db:migrate
rake test

To start the server:

thin -R config.ru start

This will fire it up on port 3000. You can set your hostname in en.yml
