em-shorty 0.5.0

One of many url shortening apps out there. Was inspired by an article I read at:

http://screencasts.org/episodes/activerecord-with-sinatra

This project is currently live at:

http://emlink.me

I added quite a few things.

1. Now uses rack-fiber_pool, em_mysql2, em-resolv-replace, em-synchrony, and em-http-request for async requests.
2. Fully localized with i18n
3. Templates are flushed out and look good.
4. Added bundler and rvm support.
5. Added less support.
6. Battery of Unit Tests.
7. Added copy support via ZeroClipboard - http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/
8. XML, JSON, YAML support.
9. Dalli for speedy memcache support.
10. Caching layer courtesy of rack-cache.
11. Tux is included for console debugging.

To start the server:

thin -R config.ru start

This will fire it up on port 3000.

To run the tests:

RACK_ENV=test rake db:migrate
rake test

To launch a console:
